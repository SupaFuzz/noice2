            task set #1 (keep in mind we're keeping this dumb)
            --------------------------------------------------
            1) [DONE 1/16/25 @ 1835] create noiceMezoRemulatorAPI.js as a subclass of noiceMezoAPI

            2) [DONE 1/16/25 @ 1835] noiceMezoRemulatorAPI.getFormFields()
               this will call noiceMezoAPI.getFile() with a hardcoded name
               of `formDefinition_${schema}`, get back json, parse it and return it

            3) [DONE 1/16/25 @ 1933] write some kinda script to upload both versions of all the schemas
               because I've tried doing this by hand and it's a royal pain in the arse

            4) [DONE 1/16/25 @ 1945] refactor getAPI() to get the noiceMezoRemulatorAPI instance

            5) [DONE 1/16/25 @ 1957] refactor updateFormDefinitions() logic on error condition
               still install from the flatfile or whatever, its just that the
               error codes n such will be different

            6) noicePGRestAPI.logout()
               is presently a placeholder that does nothing but resolves as expected to keep
               getAPI() working. We need to actually implement a logout function here lol

                    OK so this is complicated somewhat
                    this explains in principle how it can be accomplished
                    https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/tutorials/tut1.html#bonus-topic-immediate-revocation

                    it's going to boil down to this

                        1) a table .. say ... basic_auth.user_logout
                        2) an extra claim in the JWT ... something like sessionid: <guid>
                        3) logout function writes a row to user_logout with the sessionid in the JWT
                           that's literally the only thing you get. you call it, it pulls apart your
                           JWT, finds the session id and writes it to the blacklist here with the
                           timestamp the token was gonna expire on, so we know when to prune 'em
                         4) basic_auth.check_token() barfs if the sessionid is in the blacklist
                         5) pg_cron prunes the user_logout table every minute or whatever


            LOH noiceMezoRemulatorThread.js // MARK @#198







-- eventually but not here
1) create remulator schema
